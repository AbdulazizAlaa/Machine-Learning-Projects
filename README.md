# Machine-Learning-Projects
Here are some small implementations of Machine learining algorithms did for Data mining course and Deep Learning course in college, beside other projects i do on my own.

# Algorithms
> Single layer Perceptron
* Implementation of Single layer Perceptron (iris dataset) using Numpy lib.
* Implementation of Single layer Perceptron (iris dataset) using Theano framework.


> Multi Layers Neural Network
* Implementation of Neural Network with one hidden layer (MNIST dataset) using Theano framework.
* Implementation of Neural Network with two hidden layers (MNIST dataset) using Theano framework.
* Implementation of Neural Network with two hidden layers using autoencoder for pretraining (MNIST dataset) using Theano framework.

> Pattern Recognition
* recognizing of some simple hand gestures.
